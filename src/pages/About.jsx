          Sharon Abramson is an aspiring front-end web developer. Sharon has spent the past 10 years studying and working as an Early Childhood Educator. Looking for a change, Sharon began to explore different career options where there are options to work remote and where the work isn't as physically demanding. Knowing some people who have succeeded in finding jobs in the tech industry after completing a coding bootcamp, Sharon started looking deeper into the world of tech, and specifically web development. She has enjoyed solving problems, treating each challenge as a puzzle that must be solved. Sharon lives in Toronto, enjoys cooking, playing video games, and spending time with her partner and cat.
